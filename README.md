# aoc2021

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021/about) (AOC) is an advent calendar of small programming puzzles. Although participants are allowed to use any programming language they want, I decided to use Python particularly to learn about more libraries. So I am using this event as an excuse/opportunity to get myself more familliar with a programming language I use every day. Without unique challenges, I find it harder to explore a language.

This repository includes a file with all of my answers for the 2021 event. In order for the scripts to run, they will need a data file in .txt form. You can go to [the calendar](https://adventofcode.com/2021) and pick a day. Download the data file for the day n and rename it to n.txt in the same directory as my main file.
